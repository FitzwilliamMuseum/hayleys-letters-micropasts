## How to transcribe the card index

Transcribing these letters varies in difficulty due to the hand writing, layout and information contained. What we would like you to do, is to capture some structured data. The fields we would like captured are:

* The Registration mark
* The date of the letter
* The body of the letter
* Any comments you may have
